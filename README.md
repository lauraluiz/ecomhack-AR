#### Visualize your way towards a happy shopping


Not knowing your way around a supermarket or warehouse can greatly slow you down when you are planning on buying some goods. You end up running from side to side trying to find that very well hidden item, as if you were on a quest for the Holy Grail. So why don't we turn Augmented Reality on and directly visualize where those items are?

Just fill your shopping cart with everything you need via any of our multiple channels (we are omnichannel, you can fill it anywhere!). Once you arrive to the place, just open the Shopiway app in your smartphone and enter your customer email: you can quickly see those items in your shopping cart around you.
